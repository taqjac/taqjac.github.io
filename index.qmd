I’m Tiago Jacinto, a lecturer at the [Faculty of Medicine of the University of Porto](http://med.up.pt) and [Porto Health School](http://ess.ipp.pt), specializing in respiratory physiology and digital health.

My work focuses on pulmonary function, respiratory diseases, and innovative technologies in clinical practice.

I hold a PhD in Clinical Research from the University of Porto, where I studied exhaled nitric oxide, and a master’s in Medical Informatics, developing diagnostic decision support tools.

As a researcher in [CINTESIS](http://cintesis.eu), I work on projects using data science and digital health to improve patient care, with widely published research.
